# ls-it
A new idea for a to-do list that features event based automation

## WIP


You'll need a config.js file in `/` that looks like this:

```js
module.exports = {
  email: {
    user: 'GMAIL_EMAIL',
    pass: 'GMAIL_PASSWORD'
  }
}
```

You'll need a webhooks-alias.json file in `/` that looks like this:

```json
[]
```
